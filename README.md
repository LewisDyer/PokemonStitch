# PokémonStitch
This repo contains two main scripts:

* `scrape_source.py` takes all of the Pokémon designs from the Original Stitch website, downloads the images and saves them locally. This includes all currently available designs, including Limited Edition designs.
* `tile_images.py` takes these images, and generates a set of wallpapers for these images, with a user-determined resolution.
